# CS370-Assignments

To run this file first start the enviroment /myenv from the requirements.txt
Within the enviroment run python3 CS370DroneFollowMe.py. This file will preform the object detection and apply the kalman filters and output the new video to the file directory.

You can disregard the prepareCOCOdataset.py, in the beginning I was unsure if it was going to be needed or not because I based this Assignment's script structure on the Assignment 2's script.


Open the third videos tracked mp4 video. I was having the best results with this video.
